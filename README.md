# Personal Budgeting App

A React application to help you track income, expenses, and savings goals. Bootstrapped with Create React App, it offers an intuitive interface for categorizing transactions, visualizing spending trends, and planning budgets.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Starts the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your budgeting dashboard.  
The page reloads on edits and displays any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in watch mode.  
Write and run unit tests for components and business logic. See the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) guide for details.

### `npm run build`
Bundles the app for production into the `build` folder.  
Generates optimized, minified files with content hashes—ready for deployment.

### `npm run eject`
⚠️ One‑way operation. Ejecting gives you full control over the build setup (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) but cannot be undone. Use only if you need custom configuration beyond the default.
