Personal Budgeting App
A React application to help you track income, expenses, and savings goals. Bootstrapped with Create React App, it offers an intuitive interface for categorizing transactions, visualizing spending trends, and planning budgets.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Starts the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view your budgeting dashboard.
The page reloads on edits and displays any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in watch mode.
Write and run unit tests for components and business logic. See the running tests guide for details.

npm run build
Bundles the app for production into the build folder.
Generates optimized, minified files with content hashes—ready for deployment.

npm run eject
⚠️ One‑way operation. Ejecting gives you full control over the build setup (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) but cannot be undone. Use only if you need custom configuration beyond the default.
